<a name="about"><h2>About</h2></a>
This lightweight audio analysis suite was written <b><i>for educational purposes only</i></b> 
over a period of 4 days.<br>
It's amazing how much you can accomplish with minimal knowledge of Python programming.<br>
<br>
The name "SHAART" uses the author's initials (S.H.) in homage to the famous "SMAART" set of acoustics analysis tools.<br> 
That and "SHAART" is just hilarious to say, for other reasons. <br>
<i>(Note: "homage" = parody, derivative work = fair use = please don't sue.)</i><br>

<a name="notes"><h2>Release Notes/Issues</h2></a>
<ul>
 <li>Despite saying WAV file everywhere, the newest version of SHAART will read AIFF files too.  And the previous issue with 24-bit PCM WAV files has been resolved.</li>
<li> You don't need a WAV file to use the room mode calculator or the Sabine calculator.  </li>
<li> No you can't get a logarithmic frequency scale for the spectrogram.  Not yet.</li>
<li> For waterfall plots, it doesn't clear the window if you change the input data, resulting in multiple plots on the same page.  Bug or feature?</li>
</ul>

invSpectro (above) created the file <a href="lena.wav">lena.wav</a>, which has a spectrogram shown below:<br>
<img src="screenshots/lena_spectro.jpg" width=600><br>
<br>
And interestingly, if lena.wav is encoded as an MP3, then re-read and re-written as a WAV, one can see the "lossyness" of the MP3:<br>

<br>
One can also apply various audio plugins to the sound and see the effect on the image, e.g. echo:<br>

And here's an interesting one: a "leveler" effect turns Lena into a vampire:<br>

<a name="source"><h2>Running from Source</h2>
<b>Running SHAART.py from source, via Python and MacPorts:</b><br>
First, we'll assume you have already <a href="https://www.macports.org/install.php">installed MacPorts</a>. (Hint: To get the XCode Command Line Tools without creating an Apple Developer account, after you install Xcode, go into a terminal shell and run "xcode-select --install".  Voila!)<br>
Then make sure you have all the ports/packages you need:<br>
"sudo port install py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-matplotlib py27-pil py27-pyqt4 py27-pyaudio libsndfile; sudo easy_install-2.7 scikits.audiolab "<br>
Then don't forget to run python select:<br>
"sudo port select python python27"<br>
Then you should be good to go!  Just "tar xvfz SHAART.tar.gz", then "cd SHAART".<br> 
Finally, "./SHAART.py" should run it!
<br>
<br>
Or, for the truly ambitious:<br>
<b>Building a SHAART.app binary from source</b><br>
Make sure you can run SHAART.py as described above, before proceeding.  The build requires py2app, which used to have issues with
MacPorts, however the newer versions of MacPorts seemed to work now.  So, run <br>
"sudo port install py27-py2app"<br>
<!---unless you want py2app to abort the build with the error "New Mach-O header is too large to relocate", you will need to take 
drastic measures, as follows... (The following info gleaned from <a href="http://www.danplanet.com/blog/2009/02/15/using-py2app-with-gtk/">here</a>.)<br>
<ul>
<li>
First, back up your /opt/local directory, because you're about to break <b>everything</b>:  "cd /opt; sudo cp -r local local.bak"</li>
<li>Then uninstall MacPorts (that's right): following <a href="http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.macports.uninstalling.html">these instructions</a>.</li>
<li>
Then do a <a href="https://www.macports.org/install.php">fresh install of MacPorts</a>. 
Before installing other ports, edit the file (as superuser) /opt/local/share/macports/Tcl/port1.0/portconfigure.tcl
so that the line "default configure.ldflags" reads:  <br>
default configure.ldflags   {"-L${prefix}/lib -Xlinker -headerpad_max_install_names"}<br>
</li>

<li>You are now free to re-install <b>every port you ever installed</b>, including the list above. </li>
-->

Then cd into the SHAART source directory and run<br>
"/opt/local/bin/python setup.py py2app"
<br>and wait around while it builds.  If successfull, you will find "SHAART.app" in a new subdirectory called "dist"!
